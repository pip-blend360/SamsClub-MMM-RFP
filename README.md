## Client Roles
I defined several Sam's club personas in the Claude.md file. These agents should be consulted at any decision point. When consulted they will write a short document. The Sams-club-project-manager will be in charge of the document. The document should have a logical title. 

## Roles:
1. Pip/Joe – Technical leads
Lead the technical response. Ensure the fundamentals are strong while clearly articulating what differentiates us and how the solution scales.
1. Tom H – TPM / process owner
Own end-to-end orchestration: timeline, asks, dependencies, pricing inputs, and onshore/offshore mix. I’ll work closely with Tom on shaping the commercial construct.
1. Dimo/Meghesh – Client-side perspective
Stay close to the client to pressure-test the narrative and weave in context, signals, and feedback throughout.
1. Meghesh – Internal communications
Keep the broader team informed with regular updates (pipeline call, key checkpoints).
1. Tom - once we receive the full scope, let’s move to daily huddles to stay aligned and move quickly. If you need administrative support, please loop in Adam A.
1. Lucien: validation, business activation, and overall sanity-checking of the approach from a business perspective.
